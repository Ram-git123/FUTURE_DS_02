# FUTURE_DS_02
"Interactive Power BI Dashboard and Data Analysis for Task 2 of the Future Interns Data Science Internship. Focused on Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker"

*Project Description*: "As part of my Data Science internship at Future Interns, I was tasked with transforming a raw dataset into an actionable business intelligence tool. This project (Task 2) demonstrates the end-to-end process of data analysis, from cleaning and modeling to visual storytelling.

📌 *Project Overview*
The objective of this project was to analyze social media ad campaign data (such as Facebook and Instagram Ads) to evaluate marketing performance. The goal of the analysis was to transform raw campaign metrics into an interactive dashboard that helps businesses understand their Click-Through Rate (CTR), Return on Investment (ROI), and overall audience engagement to optimize future ad spend.

🛠️ *Tools Used*

*Power BI*: For data cleaning (Power Query), data modeling, and creating the interactive dashboard.

*Excel/CSV*: Source dataset containing campaign performance metrics.

*DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)*: Used to calculate key metrics such as ROI, average CPC (Cost Per Click), and conversion rates.

🗝️ *Key Insights*

*Performance Trend*: Identified how engagement and reach fluctuated over the campaign period, pinpointing specific days or weeks with peak user interaction.

*Success Metric*: Evaluated which platforms (e.g., Facebook vs. Instagram) or ad types delivered the highest Return on Investment (ROI) and lowest Cost Per Click (CPC).

*Strategic Recommendation*: Based on the data, it is recommended to reallocate budget towards the top-performing demographic segments (age, region, or device) and high-performing ad creatives to maximize future campaign efficiency.
